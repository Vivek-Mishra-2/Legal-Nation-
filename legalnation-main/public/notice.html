            <p>

            </p>
            <p> 
                2-	That, at the time of destruction/demolition on your side constructed portion which is attached to my property caused heavy damage to my property. After which I had inform about this damage to beamy owner of the property in question that is OP no.-1.
            </p>
            <p> 
                3-	That, On my notifying about this Huge damage to you. You had prima facie neglect it but after giving several oral notification, you had told me that there will be a construction of a building immediately after the destruction on the said property and at that time you will repair all the damages of my property as compensation.  
            </p>
            <p> 
                That, destruction that was taken place on the said property was completed 5 months later and from then I have not received any assurance about reconstruction on the said property and even any of the person associated with the said property is not seen here, as it gives the assumption that the destruction on the said property is only done with the intention to damage my property and cause me the mental pressure and anxiety.    
            </p>
            <p> 
                5-	That, due to winter season there was lot of fog and moist which causes the internal damage to my property, such as damp etc, which will affect the structure of my house.  
            </p>
            <p> 
                6-	That, Afterwards on dated 7/12/2021 I also mailed letters to the builders who I saw here at the time of destruction as to notify them about the conditions of my property and asked the reason for the said, but as of you they also did not respond. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                7-	That, on dated 28/01/2022 I mailed another letters to the Builders and according to this letter I had gave them 7 days time to respond on the same, but they neither responded previously nor this time. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                8-	That, now I am in very tensed situation because of this matter and also apprehending that you only took this careless destruction on your property to cause damage to my property and giving me mental pressure and anxiety. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                9-	That, I hereby by this letter informing you that after my several oral and written reminders and patiently asking about the current condition of the same, neither your builder had informed me nor you, therefore I am in very forcedness condition and going to proceed further in the legal process against all of you, if after receiving this letter like previous times you did not respond to me.
